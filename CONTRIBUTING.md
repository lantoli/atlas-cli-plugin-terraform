# Contributing to the Atlas CLI plugin for Terraform's MongoDB Atlas Provider

WIP

## Building

You can build the binary plugin by running `make build`. You'll need to have Go installed. Then you can run directly the generated binary `./bin/binary terraform [command]` to test your changes.

## Using the plugin from the CLI

You can also use the plugin with your changes from the CLI by running: `make local` and following the instructions displayed.
